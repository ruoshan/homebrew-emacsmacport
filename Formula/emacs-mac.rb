      This is YAMAMOTO Mitsuharu's experimental "Mac port" addition to
      GNU Emacs 24. This provides a native GUI support for Mac OS X
      10.4 - 10.10. After installing, see README-mac and NEWS-mac
      in #{prefix} for the port details.

      Emacs.app was installed to:
        #{prefix}

      To have it accessible from /Applications (using Spotlight 
      and Finder for instance), execute the following commands:

        rm /Applications/Emacs
        osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to make alias file to POSIX file "#{prefix}/Emacs.app" at POSIX file "/Applications"'

      OLD INSTRUCTIONS BELOW (WHICH WILL NOT WORK WITH SPOTLIGHT):

      To link the application to default Homebrew App location:
        brew linkapps
      or:
        ln -s #{prefix}/Emacs.app /Applications

      For an Emacs.app CLI starter, see:
